# Funny Application

- This project is being implemented by the idea of buiding a ecosystem that using microservices architecture.
- The main idea is building a simple ecommerce system in which includes Backend, Frontend and also Chatbot.
  At this point of time, we just keep in mind a little bit about using ML, IoT,...but I hope that it'll happen in the future.
- The project doesn't care too much about which technologies, platforms you are in use, we just want to make it working together, connecting services together for learning purpose.
